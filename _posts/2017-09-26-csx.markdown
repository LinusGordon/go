The Computer Science Exchange is group of students interested in promoting Computer Science education and fostering community within the department here at Tufts.

We hold tech-talks and meetings once a week in Halligan Hall, and we'd love to meet you. Feel free to <a href="http://eepurl.com/-5_eX">subscribe to our e-list</a> and check out our <a href="https://www.facebook.com/TuftsCSX">facebook page</a>.
